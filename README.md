Assessment Details

Title: American Flag
Task: Write a Java program to print an American flag on the screen.


//*****Description*****
First of all, I created a command line Java project using the platform IntelliJ IDEA. I used For Loop to print the American flag using * and = symbols. 
I choose to use for loop because it was suggested by my Programming module teacher and using For Loop it became easier to do this task. 
I learned using For Loop from lecture in programming season at UWL University by my module leader Dr.Ikram Ur Rehman. 
I also did some research online to learn better the topic.

Lines 1-5
Line from 1 to 5 contain general information about the project.
Line 8
I created a class called Main.
Line 10
I created the entry point of my Java Application the main method.
Lines 11-14
To print the flag with for loop I created 2 String type variables. First variable name is StarStripesLine_Flag in line 12 which contain 2 lines, one with six stars and equals symbols for the first part of flag. Second Variable name is StripesLine_Flag in line 14 which contain 1 line with equals symbols.
Lines 15-18
I created the first for loop to print 4 times (8 lines in flag) StarStripesLine_Flag variable.
Lines 19-20
Line 19 and 20 are to print 9th line of American flag.
Lines 21-24
I created the second for loop for my application to print 6 times StripesLine_Flag variable.




//****General Idea or logic behind code:
1.	First For Loop to create first part of the Flag.
2.	Print 9th line of the flag using SOUT (System.out.println();).
3.	Second For loop to create second part of the flag.
